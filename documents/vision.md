## Sk8Meet: Connecting the Skating Community

### Vision Statement

Sk8Meet will transform how street skating events are organized, promoted, and experienced. By providing a unified platform for event management, route planning, and community engagement, Sk8Meet will reduce the administrative burden on organizers while creating a more engaging and accessible experience for all participants. Our vision is to support the growth of street skating communities worldwide by making it easier to organize safe, enjoyable events that bring people together through their shared passion for skating.

### The Problem

Street skating communities worldwide currently rely on a patchwork of tools and manual processes to organize their events. Whether operating with centralized committees or distributed volunteer networks, and regardless of running year-round or seasonally, these organizations face similar challenges. Facebook events, WhatsApp groups, email communications, and various route planning tools create a fragmented experience that is difficult to manage and often leads to communication gaps. Many marshals don't use social media, making coordination challenging, and the current route planning tools aren't designed with skaters' specific needs in mind.

These challenges make organizing events more time-consuming than necessary and can impact community engagement. When events aren't effectively communicated or when routes aren't properly planned for skating conditions, the experience suffers for everyone involved. Different organizational structures face unique challenges - centralized committees often experience bottlenecks, while distributed networks may struggle with consistency and coordination.

### The Solution

Sk8Meet will provide a comprehensive, mobile-first platform specifically designed for street skating communities. The application will streamline event planning, marshal coordination, route management, and community engagement through an intuitive interface accessible to users of all technical abilities.
